#' Inspect and validate the content of a factory
#'
#' `validate_factory()` can be used to inspect the content of a factory and make
#' everything looks fine. This includes various sanity checks listed in details
#' that will error if a problem is found.
#' 
#' @inheritParams compile_reports
#'
#' @details
#' Checks run on the factory include:
#'   * the factory directory exists;
#'   * the factory_config file exist;
#'   * all mandatory folders exist - by default these are 'report_sources/'
#'     and 'outputs/';
#' 
#' @return A list with 4 entries:
#'   * root - the root folder path of the factory;
#'   * factory_name - the name of the report factory;
#'   * report_sources - the name of the report_sources folder; and
#'   * outputs - the name of the outputs folder.
