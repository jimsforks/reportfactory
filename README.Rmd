# Welcome to reportfactory!

<br>
**<span style="color: red;">NOTE</span>**

This version of {reportfactory} works in a very different way to the previous
unreleased version.  For those already using {reportfactory} in their pipelines
you can obtain the old version using the {remotes} package:

```{r installold, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("reconhub/reportfactory@old_version")
``` 

You can also download it directly from
https://github.com/reconhub/reportfactory/releases/tag/old_version.

## reportfactory in a nutshell 

{reportfactory} is a R package which facilitates a workflow for compiling
multiple `.Rmd` reports within a folder. 

There a few key principles it adheres to:

- *Simplicity* Only focusses on the compilation of reports not data management. 
- *Reproducible* Time-stamped folder structure and customisable subfolder make
  viewing the same report over time a breeze.
- *Time-saving* Easy convenience functions to reports based on regular
  expressions.

## Installing the package

To install the development version of the package, use:

```{r install2, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("reconhub/reportfactory")
```



## Quick start

### Step 1 - Create a new factory
Create and open a new factory. Here, we create the factory with mostly the
default settings but stay in our current working directory (set `move_in` to 
TRUE to switch directories).


```{r creation}
library(reportfactory)
new_factory("my_factory", path = tempdir())
```

```{r, setwd, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = fs::path(tempdir(), "my_factory"))
```

### Step 2 - Add your reports
Here we've already created some with most of the default arguments being set to
TRUE (the default). These default settings include both an example report and
some associated data (`report_sources/example_report.Rmd` and 
`data/raw/example_data.csv`).  The helper functions below show the state of the
factory.

```{r listing}
list_reports()       # list all available report sources
list_deps()          # list all of the dependencies of the reports
list_outputs()       # currently empty
```

### Step 3 - Compile report(s)

The `compile_reports()` function can be used to compile a report using regular
expressions matched against the full filename of reports within the factory. 

This ability to use of regular expressions is useful when you're actively
working on developing your reports but once the factory is setup we recommend
passing full filenames to the function so it is always clear what will be built.

```{r compile}
compile_reports( 
  reports = "example_report.Rmd"
)
```

Use `list_ouputs()` to view the report outputs.
```{r outputs}
list_outputs()
```

`compile_reports()` can also be used to pass a set of parameters to use with a
parameterised report (here we use a subfolder argument to distinguish the
parameterised reports).

```{r compileparams}
compile_reports(
  reports = "example_report.Rmd",
  params = list(grouped_plot = FALSE),
  subfolder = "regional"
)
list_outputs()
```

Note that reports can also be an integer or a logical vector, in which case it
is interpreted as a subset of files output by list_reports(). For instance:
  
  * `compile_reports(reports = c(1, 3))` will compile the first and third
    reports listed by list_reports(); and
  * `compile_reports(reports = TRUE)` will compile all reports.

### Factory overview

If you want to have an overview of your entire factory then you can use the
`fs` package and the `dir_tree` function:
```{r dirtree}
fs::dir_tree()
```
