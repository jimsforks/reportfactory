Everything below this line, include this sentence, can be removed. These section contain examples and information about R Markdown and other useful tools.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Loading data and scripts

Data should be stored in the `data/` folder, using `data/raw` for raw, read-only data, and `data/clean` for cleaned versions. Scripts containing auxiliary R code reused across several reports can be stored in `scripts/`. All files in `data/`, `data/raw`, `data/clean` and `scripts` should be read in using `here()`. First check that this package is installed using:

```{r load_here}
if (!require("here")) {
  install.packages("here")
}
```


Then you can load data using `rio`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

path_to_file <- here::here("data", "clean",
                           "/some_data_file_2017-10-27.xlsx")
my_data <- rio::import(path_to_file)

```
